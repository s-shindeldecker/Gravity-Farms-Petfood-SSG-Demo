            <p>Welcome to Gravity Farms Petfood ‚Äî where freshness meets fur.</p>
            <p>We started Gravity Farms in the little mountain town of Gravity Falls, a quiet place with towering pines, mysterious caves, and one very opinionated raccoon that lives near the compost pile.</p>
            <p>Our founders, lifelong animal lovers and amateur cryptid hunters, were inspired by their two dogs, Wendy and Mabel, who demanded more from their kibble. Literally ‚Äî they refused to eat anything that wasn't fresh, nutritious, and served with love (and maybe a little goat cheese).</p>
            <p>Tired of the same old shelf-stable pellets, we built Gravity Farms around one simple belief:</p>
            <blockquote className="italic text-[#6A994E] my-6 border-l-4 border-[#FFD166] pl-4" style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem' }}>
              "Your pet deserves food that tastes like it came from a farm‚Ä¶ not a factory."
            </blockquote>
            <p>Every meal we make is crafted with:</p>
            <ul className="ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1" style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem' }}>
              <li>Human-grade ingredients (but please don't eat it, Carl ‚Äî it's for pets).</li>
              <li>Locally sourced vegetables and proteins (shoutout to Larry, our carrot guy).</li>
              <li>Recipes developed in consultation with real vets and very picky dogs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe in:</p>
            <ul className="ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1" style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem' }}>
              <li>Transparency (except when it comes to what's in the Secret Barn ‚Äî don't ask).</li>
              <li>Sustainability (our delivery boxes are compostable AND make great cat forts).</li>
              <li>Joyful eating experiences for pets (tail wags are our currency).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by. Whether your pet is a Wendy, a Mabel, or more of a Soos, we're glad you're here.</p>
