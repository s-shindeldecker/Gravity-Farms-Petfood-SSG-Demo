            🌱 Why Gravity Farms?

            <p>At Gravity Farms Petfood, we believe fresh isn't a trend — it's a lifestyle. Your pet didn't evolve eating beige pellets that have a shelf life longer than most sitcoms. They deserve real food, made with real ingredients, by people who actually know what a carrot looks like.</p>
            <p>So why choose Gravity Farms? Glad you asked.</p>
            <h2 className="text-[#6A994E] mt-6" style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>🥩 Fresh Ingredients, Zero Weird Stuff</h2>
            <ul className="ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1" style={{ fontSize: '1.15rem' }}>
              <li>Human-grade meats and veggies (the kind you'd recognize on a dinner plate).</li>
              <li>No artificial preservatives, fillers, or mystery powders.</li>
              <li>Recipes your dog will devour and your cat will reluctantly admit are pretty decent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 className="text-[#6A994E] mt-6" style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>🏕️ Born in Gravity Falls, Cooked with Care</h2>
            <p>Our kitchens are tucked just outside the town limits of Gravity Falls (you know, near that one weird tree that glows at night). We're proudly small-batch, proudly picky, and proudly uninterested in going "mass market."</p>
            <h2 className="text-[#6A994E] mt-6" style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>🧪 Tested by Real Pets (and One Unpaid Intern)</h2>
            <p>Our flavor testers, Wendy and Mabel, are relentless. If a meal doesn't pass the sniff test, it doesn't make it to your doorstep.</p>
            <p>We've also consulted with veterinarians, animal nutritionists, and that guy at the farmer's market who says his dog is vegan. (She's not. We checked.)</p>
            <h2 className="text-[#6A994E] mt-6" style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>📦 Delivered Fresh, Fast, and in Style</h2>
            <p>Our meals arrive chilled and ready to serve — no science experiments required. Just scoop, serve, and bask in the glory of being your pet's favorite human.</p>
            <h2 className="text-[#6A994E] mt-6" style={{ fontSize: '1.3em' }}>🐶 Fresh is Better. Gravity Farms is Fresher.</h2>
            <p>We don't cut corners. We don't make compromises. We just make pet food that feels right — because it is.</p>
            <p>Give it a try. Your pet will thank you. (Probably with a zoomie.)</p>
